Because In 15min they ask about 20 questions in job description they describe that u need basic knowledge of language and some computational knowledge, but guess what they start with list-tuple, opps , then asking questions from DSA, after that they don't satisfied they ask questions from db - normalisation and many more, after that question from sql (they ask give u a question u have to solve and send it in text in google meet),
